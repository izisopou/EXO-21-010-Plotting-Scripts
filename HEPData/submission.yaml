comment: "A data-driven search for pairs of dijet resonances with identical mass \
\ is conducted in final states with at least four jets, and results are presented \
\ for both resonant and non-resonant production modes. The search uses $138~\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of \
\ integrated luminosity collected by the CMS detector in proton-proton collisions at \
\ $\\sqrt{s}=13~\\mathrm{TeV}$. Distributions of the four-jet mass above $1.6~\\mathrm{TeV}$, and \
\ average dijet mass above $0.35~\\mathrm{TeV}$, are fit with functions to determine the backgrounds. \
\ Model independent limits, at 95$\\%$ confidence level, are reported on the production \
\ cross section of four-jet and dijet resonances.  These first LHC limits on resonant \
\ pair production at high mass, are applied to a signal model of diquarks that decay \
\ into pairs of vector-like quarks, excluding diquark masses below $7.6~\\mathrm{TeV}$ for a \
\ particular model scenario. There are two events on the tail of the distributions, \
\ with a four-jet mass of $8~\\mathrm{TeV}$ and an average dijet mass of $2~\\mathrm{TeV}$, resulting in a \
\ local significance of 3.9 standard deviations and a global significance of 1.6 \
\ standard deviations if interpreted as a signal. The non-resonant search excludes \
\ pair production of top squarks with masses between 0.50 and 0.52 $\\mathrm{TeV}$, and between \
\ 0.58 and 0.77 $\\mathrm{TeV}$, for supersymmetric R-parity-violating decays to quark pairs, \
\ significantly extending previous limits. Here, the most significant signal hypothesis \
\ occurs at an average dijet mass of $0.95~\\mathrm{TeV}$, for which the local significance is 3.6 \
\ standard deviations and the global significance is 2.5 standard deviations."
