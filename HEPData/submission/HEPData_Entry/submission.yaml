comment: "A search for pairs of dijet resonances with the same mass is conducted in final states \
\ with at least four jets. Results are presented separately for the case where the four \
\ jet production proceeds via an intermediate resonant state and for nonresonant production. \
\ The search uses a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $138~\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ \
\ collected by the CMS detector in proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13~\\mathrm{TeV}$. \
\ Model-independent limits, at 95$\\%$ confidence level, are reported on the production \
\ cross section of four-jet and dijet resonances. These first LHC limits on resonant pair \
\ production of dijet resonances via high mass intermediate states are applied to a signal \
\ model of diquarks that decay into pairs of vector-like quarks, excluding diquark \
\ masses below $7.6~\\mathrm{TeV}$ for a particular model scenario. There are two events in the tails \
\ of the distributions, each with a four-jet mass of $8~\\mathrm{TeV}$ and an average dijet mass of \
\ $2~\\mathrm{TeV}$, resulting in local and global significances of 3.9 and 1.6 standard deviations, \
\ respectively, if interpreted as a signal. The nonresonant search excludes pair production \
\ of top squarks with masses between 0.50 $\\mathrm{TeV}$ and 0.77 $\\mathrm{TeV}$, with the exception \
\ of a small interval between 0.52 and 0.58 $\\mathrm{TeV}$, for supersymmetric R-parity-violating \
\ decays to quark pairs, significantly extending previous limits. Here, the most significant excess \
\ above the predicted background occurs at an average dijet mass of 0.95 $\\mathrm{TeV}$, for which \
\ the local and global significances are 3.6 and 2.5 standard deviations, respectively."
